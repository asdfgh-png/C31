
In this project a plinko is to me made .
You're supposed to create 3 different loops. One for the divisions , one for particles and the last one is por the plinkos.
the plikos are to be set in such a way the make rows approx.4 but aren't in a straight line
the divisons are used to make containers to hold the falling particles
the particles are supposed to drop from the top of the screen, then it is supposed to move through the plinkos and the finally end in the container .
